# User Deletion Improvements

## Problem

The original `user_delete` function only deleted the user account from the database, leaving behind:
- All user's groups in the database
- All user's files in the database
- All user's files in storage (potentially thousands of files)

This caused data bloat and inconsistency in the system.

## Solution

Enhanced the `user_delete` function to perform a complete cleanup before deleting the user account.

## Implementation Details

### New Cleanup Process

The `user_delete` function now performs these steps in order:

1. **Delete all user's groups** from the database using `GroupApi.delete_all(user_id)`
2. **Delete all user's files** from the database using `CypherApi.delete_all(user_id)`
3. **Delete all user's files** from storage using `Storage.del_all(user_id)` (with batch processing)
4. **Delete the user account** using `UserApi.delete(user_id)`

### Key Features

- **Complete Data Cleanup**: Removes all traces of user data from the system
- **Batch Processing**: Uses the new batch deletion system for storage cleanup
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs each step of the deletion process for monitoring
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with user deletion even if some data cleanup fails
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and logging for each cleanup step

### Logging Output

The function provides detailed logs for monitoring:

```
[info] Starting user deletion process for user abc123
[info] Deleted 15 groups for user abc123
[info] Deleted 1247 files from database for user abc123
[info] Deleted 1247 files from storage for user abc123
[info] Successfully deleted user abc123 and all associated data
```

## API Changes

The function signature remains the same for backward compatibility:

```elixir
@spec user_delete(id :: binary()) :: :ok | :error
def user_delete(id)
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Consistency**: No orphaned data left in the system
2. **Storage Efficiency**: Prevents storage bloat from deleted users
3. **Compliance**: Helps with data privacy regulations (complete data removal)
4. **Monitoring**: Detailed logs for auditing and troubleshooting
5. **Scalability**: Uses batch processing to handle users with large amounts of data

## Error Handling

- Individual cleanup steps that fail are logged but don't stop the process
- User deletion continues even if some data cleanup fails
- Detailed error messages help with troubleshooting
- Returns `:error` only if the final user account deletion fails

## Testing

- Added comprehensive tests for the new functionality
- Tests verify that data cleanup is performed
- Tests handle edge cases like users with no data
- Tests verify error handling for non-existent users

## Usage

No changes needed in calling code - the function works the same way:

```elixir
# This now automatically cleans up all user data
case Context.user_delete(user_id) do
  :ok -> 
    # User and all data successfully deleted
  :error -> 
    # User deletion failed
end
```

This enhancement ensures that when a user account is deleted, all associated data is properly cleaned up, maintaining system integrity and preventing data bloat.
